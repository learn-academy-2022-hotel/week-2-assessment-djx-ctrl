# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: From my own understading of the difference between a parameter and an argument is a parameter place holder and argument is data moving through.

Researched answer: When researching I found that parameters are placeholder variables inside a function that data can be passed through and arguments are that data that is passed through the function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: For .map() a predefined parameter is value which is required. As far as the others I dont't recall at the moment.

Researched answer: .map() has three predefined parameters in which one is required and two are optional. The first is value, its required. The last two are index and array which are both optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map shows each value in the array and produces a new array thats the same length as the previous. Filter on the other hand returns a new array but shorter than the original.

Researched answer: Map displays each value within the array and returns a new array of the same length. Also have to assign map to a new variable. Filter performs iteration based on certain conditions it is given then returns a new subset array and has a built in if statement.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration from my knowledge are performed over and over until some condition that was set is met.

Researched answer: Referencing some of the lecture notes iteration is a set of instructions performed in arrays or strings over and over until a conditon is met.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: From what I remember a class is a recipe for making an object. A object can have many key value pairs and are inside curly braces.

Researched answer: Classes are a type of function that has data and behavior. Classes are the recipe for objects. They use specific keywords like constructor, this, and new. Class names are always capitalized and are PascalCased. Objects are collections of key value pairs inside curly braces. Objects contain functions and are comma separated. Objects can be destructured which is a way to create a variable with a key and assign the pathway for it.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I am not familiar with hoisting. I'm sure we have went over it or its some way we write the code but I might not be familiar with the term as it is being used.

Researched answer: From what I researched hoisting in Javascript is variable and function names that can be used before declaring them. The declarations are pushed to the top so prevent error.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: a general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the customer.

2. Spread operator: it takes in an iterable and expands it into individual elements.

3. React state: a built in REact object that is used to contain data about the component.

4. React props: passes data from one component to another.

5. DOM events: a signal that something has occcured and can be triggered by user interactions.
